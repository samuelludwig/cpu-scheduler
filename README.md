# cpu-scheduler
CPU Scheduler Simulation project for COM310

Task: Create an interactive webapp that displays the impact of different kinds 
of algorithms regarding the scheduling of CPU processes.

The tech stack employed will be as follows:

- Backend: Elixir + Phoenix
- Frontend: Elm

## Raison D'etre

- Elixir is a language that I am pretty confident with by now, but the Phoenix 
framework not as much, so this is an opportunity to learn and work more with 
that, and web dev in general.
- I wanted to try out using Dave Thomas' "Component-based Design/Architecture" 
idea, meaning each part of my program should be built as if it were a separate 
library, with a well defined API that can be used by any module calling it.
- I wanted an opportunity to try out TDD on something more complex then a toy 
problem/kata.
- I've been looking for an excuse to try the Elm programming language since 
going through the tutorial some time ago, but I haven't needed to build a 
front-end for an application in quite some time.
